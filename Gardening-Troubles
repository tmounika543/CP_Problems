<h2>Problem: Gardening Troubles</h2>
<p>Vignesh is a busy gardener who needs to water his plants. However, his gardening machine broke down, and he couldn't fix it. He decided to leave it for now and focus on watering his plants.</p>
<p>Vignesh has three types of plants: small, medium, and large. Each type requires a specific amount of water:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small plants: 2 liters each, but if there are more than 10 small plants, each additional plant requires only 1 liter</li>
<li>Medium plants: 5 liters each, but if there are an odd number of medium plants, each plant requires 1 extra liter</li>
<li>Large plants: 10 liters each, but if there are exactly 5 large plants, each plant requires 2 extra liters</li>
</ul>
<p>Vignesh has S small plants, M medium plants, and L large plants. How many liters of water will Vignesh need to water all his plants?</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Return the output as an integer.</p>
